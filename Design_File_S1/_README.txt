Design File S1

Design files (in STEP format) for constructing the 3D models representing C. elegans and its surroundings.

These STEP files need to be copied to the Zemax sourced folder to get Software S1 working.

On a Windows PC, the target folder will be:

C:\Users\...\Documents\Zemax\Objects\CAD Files
